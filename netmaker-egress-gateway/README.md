# Setting up an Egress Gateway Using Netmaker

## Overview

What is an `Egress Gateway` and more important, why do you need one?

`Ingress` deals with `inbound` traffic, whereas `Egress` deals with `outbound` traffic. Going further, there are two key aspects to keep in mind:

1. Security implications.
2. Having a well defined model and set of measures for your infrastructure (either cloud based or on-premise), so that each entity from the system cannot compromise the others.

Suppose you have a private network and a bunch of machines or nodes inside the network. Do you really trust any machine in the network doing the right thing? In a sense you do, because you set up all those machines, thus knowing what applications are running on each. But even so, you may have many people working with you and accessing those machines, thus performing various operations. Of course, as a system administrator you would limit access and assign roles (RBAC), so that you have a finer control of who has access and to what resources.

What about network traffic ? In the same way, you should consider limiting or restricting both inbound and outbound traffic. Basically, nothing goes in or out without explicitly being allowed to, via explicit network policies in place. On the long term, imagine what would happen if any machine (or application running on it) is allowed to carry network traffic (in our out) without explicitly being allowed to do so. Soon, things can get out of control. By having a dedicated node (or gateway) in your network to control in or out traffic, things become much easier to manage and observe. Not only that, it also allows you to enforce more strict policies, and watch it more thoroughly by performing audits.

You already have `Firewalls` in place to allow or restrict traffic, which is an important security measure as well. `VPCs` isolate your resources (`Droplets`, `Load Balancers`, etc) between clusters in same or different regions. The `Egress` use case, is more related to how you control and route traffic between VPCs. An `Egress Gateway` is just a `NAT Gateway` in essence.

This guide is about setting up an `Egress Gateway` to control and route traffic between a `Kubernetes` cluster (e.g. `DOKS`) or a `Droplet` from one `VPC` to another, in same or different regions. Another use case is to allow secure connections to an external service, like a managed database for example. The `Egress Gateway` is usually deployed to a dedicated machine with a `static public IP` (or `floating IP`, in case of `DigitalOcean`), and runs dedicated software. Such an example is [Netmaker](https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker), which you will discover in this tutorial.

## Introducing Netmaker

[Netmaker](https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker) is a tool for creating and managing virtual overlay networks. You can create as many overlay networks as you want, and connect different machines from different data centers transparently. At its heart Netmaker is using [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com) to do the magic. Being an overlay network, it doesn't affect your existing network setup, it just sits on top of it offering a lot of flexibility and possibilities.

`Netmaker` allows you to define and create `private networks`, just as `VPCs` are. It's built with `security` in mind as well. The way it works is by creating `secure tunnels` across machines, a feature offered by `WireGuard`. Netmaker follows a `client-server` model, and consists of two parts:

1. The `admin server`, called `Netmaker`.
2. `Agents` (or `clients`) deployed on each machine (or node), called `Netclients`.

The Netmaker server doesn't deal with network traffic (although it can be told to, if needed). The main role of the server is to keep configuration state, and control or manage user defined networks. Each machine participating in the network, is called a `Node`. For the most part, Netmaker serves `configuration` data to `Nodes`, telling them how they should configure themselves. `Netclient` is the `agent` that performs the actual configuration.

Traffic goes between nodes, peer to peer. On the other hand, each node can relay messages as well and improve network resiliency. Netmaker allows you to define and create `mesh networks`, which is a really powerful feature. Mesh networks add resiliency because the network can heal itself. All nodes are interconnected and contribute to traffic. If one node dies, others will take its place, thus offering transparency.

`Netmaker` also allows you to define `Egress Gateways` in a very simple manner. You just select one node from your private network and an interface for outbound traffic, and then tell Netmaker to configure it as an Egress Gateway (all the hard work is handled by Netmaker).

Being based on `WireGuard` it offers `VPN` support, so you can create various configurations, like:

1. Personal (Private Browsing).
2. Remote Access.
3. Site-to-Site.
4. Mesh (virtual LAN/WAN).

`WireGuard` is `fast` and industry proven, which is another real advantage. Below picture shows the Netmaker architecture and how it manages networks:

![Netmaker Architecture](assets/images/netmaker_arch.png)

For more information and details about the inner workings and architecture, please visit the official Netmaker [design](https://netmaker.readthedocs.io/en/master/architecture.html) page related to this topic.

Next, you're going to learn how to install and configure the main `Netmaker` server, as well as `Netclients` on each node from your private network. For now Netmaker doesn't offer `High Availability` features, but it is planned in a future release.

## Installing the Netmaker Server

Netmaker server can be installed very quickly and painless via the [DigitalOcean Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps). Just choose the desired application that you want to install, and a wizard will pop-up, which will guide you through the process.

### DigitalOcean Marketplace Guide

Please follow below steps to install the Netmaker server via the DigitalOcean `Marketplace` platform:

1. First, navigate to the marketplace page, for the [Netmaker Application](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/netmaker), and click on the `Create Netmaker Droplet` blue button:

    ![Netmaker Marketplace App](assets/images/netmaker_marketplace_app.png)
2. Next, you will be redirected to the Droplet creation page. Choose a plan that suffices your needs. A basic one of `$5 per month`, should be sufficient in most of the cases.
3. Then, choose a region that's closest to you, and the corresponding VPC.
4. Now, don't forget to add your `SSH` key for accessing the Netmaker Droplet console later on.
5. Finally, create the `Netmaker Droplet`. Optionally, you can change the `hostname`, and add custom `tags`. It's a good idea to have backups enabled as well.

Now, please wait for the Netmaker Droplet to be created and provisioned. In the end, you should get something similar to:

![Netmaker Droplet Finished](assets/images/netmaker_droplet_status_complete.png)

Clicking the `Get Started` link should present you another window containing additional guides, as well as other interesting topics for Netmaker to study:

![Netmaker Guides and Walkthrough](assets/images/netmaker_additional_guides.png)

Next, you will be guided through the initial configuration steps for the Netmaker server, and how to access the web management console.

### Finishing the Netmaker Server Setup

To use the Netmaker server, you need to finish a few more steps, by following a one-time interactive guide. The interactive guide will show up only once, after you log in for the first time into the Netmaker machine, via SSH.

First, please `list` the available `Droplets`, using `doctl` (below command will show only the `machine name`, and the corresponding `public IP address`):

```shell
doctl compute droplet list --format Name,PublicIPv4
```

The output looks similar to (please note down the `Public IPv4` address for the Netmaker server from the list):

```text
Name                                   Public IPv4
basicnp-uan1e                          167.172.62.197
basicnp-uan1g                          167.172.53.77
netmaker-ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-lon1-01    209.97.179.143
```

Next, please open a terminal and SSH into the Netmaker server (please replace the `<>` placeholders accordingly):

```bash
ssh -i <YOUR_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE_NAME_HERE> root@<YOUR_NETMAKER_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP_HERE>
```

**Note:**

The private SSH key file from the above command, is the one used when installing your Netmaker server. It is not necessarily required to specify the SSH key file, if it's the same as the one from your `~/.ssh` folder.

When asked, please accept the new SSH fingerprint, and follow the on-screen instructions. Please leave the default domain name, unless you have a specific one already set up, and you want to use it here as well. Next, what's important to remember is that you don't need a default network to be created just now (answer `n` to the question) - will be touched shortly. Going further, when asked for a VPN server, answer no (`n`) again, and don't override the master key (type `n` for this question as well).

The output looks similar to:

Now, the Netmaker automation script will take care of provisioning the required server components via `docker-compose`:

```text

Netmaker setup is now complete. You are ready to begin using Netmaker.
Visit dashboard.nm.209-97-179-143.nip.io to log in
```

At the end, you will be presented with the Netmaker server dashboard link. The server itself is deployed as a set of docker containers, managed via `docker-compose`. You can check server components status, via `docker-compose`:

```shell
docker-compose ps
```

The output looks similar to (notice all components being in the `Up` state: `CoreDNS`, Netmaker `Server`, Netmaker `UI`, etc):

```text

```

Next, you will learn how to enable a `Floating IP` address for your Egress Gateway machine, to ensure a `static` or `fixed` public `IP` is always available.

## Configuring a Floating IP for Netmaker

Another great feature (offered by `DigitalOcean`) that you can benefit from, is to enable [Floating IPs](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/floating-ips) for your `Egress Gateway Droplet`. By doing this, you can ensure a `fixed` (or a `static`) public IP for the respective machine (or Droplet), which never changes. By default, the IP assigned to your Netmaker Droplet is ephemeral because it's a dynamic IP. It means, that whenever you recreate the machine, a new IP is assigned, thus your private network resources won't be able to reconnect. That's not good!

This is a two step process:

1. Enabling a `Floating IP` for the `Netmaker` server droplet.
2. Reconfiguring the `Netmaker` server to make use of the `Floating IP` address.

Ideally, you would want to configure the `Floating IP` address after installing the Netmaker server, but before defining new networks. This way, nodes will always use the `Floating IP` address to connect to the Netmaker server.

### Enabling a Floating IP for the Netmaker Droplet

From your `DigitalOcean` account web panel, navigate to [Networking -> Floating IPs](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/networking/floating_ips). Then, select your `Netmaker` server droplet and click the `Enable now` link for the `Floating IP` feature.

Alternatively, you can also accomplish the same thing via the CLI. First, list the available droplets, including their `ID` and `Name`:

```shell
doctl compute droplet list --format ID,Name
```

The output looks similar to (take a note of the droplet `ID` that you need to assign a `Floating IP` to):

```text
ID           Name
278664180    netmaker-ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-lon1-01
281956404    basicnp-u2orr
281956406    basicnp-u2orj
```

Finally, create a `Floating IP` for the `droplet` in question (in this example `278664180` was picked which corresponds to `netmaker-ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-lon1-01`):

```shell
doctl compute floating-ip create --droplet-id 278664180
```

The output looks similar to (notice the `IP` column value showing the assigned `Floating IP` address):

```text
IP                Region    Droplet ID    Droplet Name
159.65.210.139    lon1      278664180     netmaker-ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-lon1-01
```

Wait a little bit until a `Floating IP` gets assigned to your Netmaker server droplet, and then make a note of it before proceeding to the next section.

### Configuring the Netmaker Server to use the Floating IP

When using the DigitalOcean Marketplace to provision the Netmaker server, a set of docker containers get deployed and managed by docker compose. Application (or server) input parameters are controlled via the `docker-compose.yml` file. To be able to use the Floating IP address, you need to replace every instance of the dynamic IP inside the `docker-compose.yaml` file that was assigned to the Netmaker droplet initially.

For your convenience there's a script provided in this repository that automates all the required steps. The scrips assumes that the Netmaker droplet already has a Floating IP assigned. What the scripts does is:

1. Creates a backup first, for all the configuration files that it is going to change (`docker-compose.yml`, `Caddyfile`, `/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml`).
2. Sets the default gateway for the droplet to point to the anchor IP gateway. Then, makes the configuration persistent across machine reboots (works on `Ubuntu` or other `Debian` derivates that make use of [Netplan](https://netplan.io)).
3. Re-configures the Netmaker server configuration files to use the new `Floating IP` address.
4. Restarts the Netmaker server processes to apply the changes.

Please follow below steps to tell the Netmaker server to use the Floating IP address:

1. First, SSH into the Netmaker server machine:

    ```shell
    ssh root@<YOUR_NETMAKER_DROPLET_FLOATING_IP_HERE>
    ```

2. Then, fetch the script provided in this repository:

    ```shell
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitalocean/container-blueprints/main/netmaker-egress-gateway/assets/scripts/netmaker_floating_ip_config.sh > netmaker_floating_ip_config.sh 
    ```

3. Now, run the script as `root` (you can also run it via `sudo`, which is more recommended in general):

    ```shell
    bash netmaker_floating_ip_config.sh
    ```

    The output looks similar to:

    ```text

    #########################################################################################
    ```

At this point the Netmaker server is configured to use a `Floating IP` address. From now on, you can use the floating IP to access the web console, as well as your future private network nodes.

Next, a quick walkthrough for the Netmaker administration web console is presented, to get you familiarized with the user interface, as well as some basic tasks, like: creating a private network, managing access keys and nodes inspection.

## Exploring the Netmaker Server Dashboard

In general, Netmaker is managed via a simple web interface allowing you to perform administrative tasks like:

- Managing networks, Egress Gateways, Nodes, etc.
- Managing access keys for devices or nodes that need access to Netmaker resources.
- Managing external clients, like: phones, tablets or laptops accessing Netmaker resources.
- Internal DNS configuration and management.
- Users and roles for accessing the web dashboard.

### Accessing the Netmaker Dashboard

To access the Netmaker server web interface or dashboard, you can use the following URL (make sure to replace the `<>` placeholders accordingly):

```text
https://dashboard.nm.<YOUR_NETMAKER_DROPLET_DASHED_NOTATION_FLOATING_IP_HERE>.nip.io
```

Notes:

- `YOUR_NETMAKER_DROPLET_DASHED_NOTATION_FLOATING_IP_HERE` represents your Netmaker Droplet Floating IP having all dots replaced with the dash symbol: `-`. For example, if your droplet Floating IP is `159.65.210.139`, then the dashed version becomes: `159-65-210-139`.
- Based on the above example, the dashboard URL becomes: `https://dashboard.nm.159-65-210-139.nip.io`.
- Another way of finding the Netmaker dashboard URL is by SSH-ing as root to the Droplet, and then inspecting the `Caddyfile` from the home folder:

    ```shell
    cat Caddyfile
    ```

    The output looks similar to (notice the `# Dashboard` section):

    ```text
    {
    # LetsEncrypt account
    email fake@email.com

When you log in for the first time, a pop-up window will appear asking you to set the administrator user credentials. Please go ahead and set those now. Then, please go ahead and log in using the credentials set previously.

After successfully logging in, you will be presented with the main dashboard interface:

![Netmaker Main Web Interface](assets/images/netmaker_main_dashboard.png)

Next, you will discover each important section from the main dashboard that is relevant for this tutorial, like:

- `Networks`: Lets you define and manage private networks.
- `Access Keys`: Lets you manage access keys for various devices or nodes accessing private resources.
- `Nodes`: Lets you inspect and manage nodes that are part of your private network.

### Exploring the Networks Section

The `Networks` feature that Netmaker provides lets you define and manage private networks for seamlessly connecting various systems, like: Kubernetes clusters (e.g. `DOKS`), managed databases, virtual machines (e.g. Droplets) across different regions (or data centers), even across different cloud providers.

From the Netmaker main dashboard page you can access the `Networks` section by clicking the corresponding tile, as shown below:

![Networks Tile](assets/images/netmaker_networks_tile.png)

Here, you can define and manage private networks, as well as change advanced settings for each network. For more information and the available options, please consult the [Netmaker Networks](https://netmaker.readthedocs.io/en/master/ui-reference.html#networks) page from the official documentation.

### Exploring the Access Keys Section

The `Access Keys` feature that Netmaker provides, lets you define a set of keys which will then be used to allow access for other devices or nodes that needs to be part of your private network, and exchange data in a secure manner.

From the Netmaker main dashboard page you can navigate to the `Access Keys` section by clicking the corresponding tile, as shown below:

![Access Keys Tile](assets/images/netmaker_access_keys_tile.png)

This section allows you to create and manage the access keys, as well as giving you instructions on how to deploy `Netclients` for various operating systems. You cannot change the access keys or any information from this section once generated, but you can always get back here and fetch the access keys value, when needed.

For more information about access keys and the available options, please consult the [Netmaker Access Keys](https://netmaker.readthedocs.io/en/master/getting-started.html#create-a-key) page from the official documentation.

### Exploring the Nodes Section

The `Nodes` tile that Netmaker provides, lets you inspect the nodes that are part of each private network. You can also set other node(s) features, like `Egress` or `Ingress Gateway` functionality for example.

From the Netmaker main dashboard page, you can navigate to the `Nodes` section by clicking the corresponding tile, as shown below:

![Nodes Tile](assets/images/netmaker_nodes_tile.png)

Here, for every node that you have you will get details like:

- `Node name` (1).
- `Private IP` address of the node (2).
- `Network` name that this node is part of (3).
- `Egress` functionality of the node (4).
- `Ingress` functionality of the node (5).
- `Health` status of the node (6).

![Nodes Listing](assets/images/netmaker_nodes_listing.png)

Finally, if desired you can change the advanced settings for each node by clicking on its name. For more information about nodes page and available options, please consult the [Netmaker Nodes](https://netmaker.readthedocs.io/en/master/ui-reference.html#nodes) page from the official documentation.

**Important note:**

**Please bear in mind that if you change one value in the node settings page, you should do this for every node that's part of the respective network. Changes do not propagate automatically to other nodes !!!**

## Creating an Egress Gateway for DOKS

Suppose that you need to use an external service like a legacy database, for example. The database is usually located in another datacenter from another provider. Then, for security reasons, you set up a firewall for the database so that no one is able to access it, only a specific IP or set of IPs.

You can egress from DOKS cluster nodes, but it's not practical because nodes are volatile, hence their IPs. It means that on the other end (meaning the database service), you need to change firewall rules again and again to allow the new IPs. This is the most frequent example where an Egress Gateway becomes useful, and where Netmaker plays an important role.

What you usually do is, have a dedicated machine (or Droplet) where Netmaker runs and has a fixed (or static) IP assigned. Then, you deploy `Netclients` to your DOKS cluster as a `DaemonSet`, so that the cluster nodes become part of your private network that you set up via Netmaker. Going, further the Netmaker server becomes the Egress Gateway, thus allowing outbound traffic to the external service (the database in this example). Finally, the external service (database) firewall is configured to allow inbound traffic from the Netmaker Egress Gateway IP.

Below is a diagram, showing the main setup for egressing DOKS cluster traffic to an external database:

![DOKS Egress Setup](assets/images/netmaker_doks_egress_example.png)

**Important things to remember:**

- By default the Netmaker server (or the Egress Gateway in this case) will route traffic via its public interface. This is a valid use case in general because usually the Netmaker server should not be tied to a specific VPC or any network of any cloud provider. Remember that Netmaker main purpose is to create overlay networks - this is very important to remember and understand. As an example, the Netmaker server can be installed and run from your home network if desired, it just needs to be accessible via its public (or floating) IP address. Then, it's just a matter of creating `tunnels` from your home private network to your friend private network, or to whatever private datacenter you want to have access to in a secure manner.
- From a security point of view everything is encrypted, nothing goes out in the wild using clear text. More than that, `WireGuard` (the power horse running behind Netmaker) will not allow traffic from other nodes that are not part of the private network that you configured using Netmaker. Packets coming from unknown IPs are dropped. The downside is that in order for this to work, the nodes must have static IPs so that WireGuard can build the internal list of allowable (or known) IPs.

Going further, there are two steps involved:

- Configuring the `Netmaker server` to act as an `Egress Gateway`.
- Configuring `DOKS`, or installing the `Netclients` on each node of the cluster.

### Configuring Netmaker Server

In this section you will define a private network, which your DOKS cluster will be part of in the end. Then, you need to configure the Netmaker server to act as an Egress Gateway. By default, the Netmaker server itself will be part of your private network as well, thus enabling you to send outbound traffic or egress through it.

Please follow below steps to complete this section:

1. Log in to Netmaker server, as explained in the [Accessing the Netmaker Dashboard](#accessing-the-netmaker-dashboard) section of this guide.
2. Once logged in, click the `Networks` tile from the main dashboard:

    ![Access Network Section](assets/images/netmaker_networks_tile.png)
3. Then, click on the `Create Network` blue button on the right corner and fill in your own network details. You may choose any IP class and range you wish as long as it doesn't overlap with the one from your DOKS cluster, or any other Droplets from your VPC (make sure to disable `UPD Hole Punching`, as it's not needed in this example). Then, click on the `Create Network` button:

    ![Set Network Configuration](assets/images/netmaker_set_network_config.png)
4. Next, navigate to the `Nodes` section by clicking on the corresponding tile from the main dashboard. You should see a single node available - the Netmaker server itself. Click on the `Egress` button to enable egress functionality for the server, as shown below:

    ![Netmaker Egress Enable](assets/images/netmaker_enable_egress.png)

5. Please paste the following entries in the `Egress Gateway Ranges` text area of the dialog box:

    ```csv
    0.0.0.0/5,8.0.0.0/7,11.0.0.0/8,12.0.0.0/6,16.0.0.0/4,32.0.0.0/3,64.0.0.0/2,128.0.0.0/3,160.0.0.0/5,168.0.0.0/6,172.0.0.0/12,172.32.0.0/11,172.64.0.0/10,172.128.0.0/9,173.0.0.0/8,174.0.0.0/7,176.0.0.0/4,192.0.0.0/9,192.128.0.0/11,192.160.0.0/13,192.169.0.0/16,192.170.0.0/15,192.172.0.0/14,192.176.0.0/12,192.192.0.0/10,193.0.0.0/8,194.0.0.0/7,196.0.0.0/6,200.0.0.0/5,208.0.0.0/4
    ```

    **Note:**

    The above list of IP ranges allows you to egress to any resource on the public internet. In general, it's best to limit the range and allow nodes to egress only to specific ranges (like an external database for example).

    Then, in the interface box, type `eth0` and click on the `Create` button. Below picture shows the details:

    ![Egress Configuration Dialog](assets/images/netmaker_egress_gw_configuration_dialog.png)
6. Now, you need to create an access key. Please navigate to the menu on the left, and click the `Access Keys` button. In the next dialog, give the access key a name and a number of uses (`100` is a good start). Then, click on the `Create` button:

    ![Create Access Keys](assets/images/netmaker_access_key_create_final.png)
7. A new window window will pop-up, giving you the access keys, as well as instructions on how to install the clients on various platforms. For now, just copy the `Access Token` value (second text box), and save it for later use:

    ![Access Token Window](assets/images/netmaker_access_keys_and_instructions.png)

At this point the Netmaker server side configuration is done. Next, you need to install `Netclients` on your `DOKS` cluster. Then, each `Netclient` will connect to the main Netmaker server via the access token created earlier, and become part of the private network defined in the previous steps.

### Installing Netclient on DOKS Worker Nodes

`Netclient` (and `WireGuard` implicitly) is deployed as a `DaemonSet`, hence it runs on every node. This way all DOKS cluster nodes can connect and be part of your private network.

**Notes:**

- Currently, `Netclient` is not available as a `userspace` application for `DOKS`, hence the `WireGuard Controller` is needed for now, until `Gravitl` finds a better solution to solve some incompatibilities related to the Debian Linux OS used for the DOKS nodes.
- The access token is just a one-time token used by `Netclient` initially. Afterwards, it creates its own password internally to authenticate with the main Netmaker server.

The next part of this section assumes that you already have a `DOKS` cluster up and running, and that `kubectl` is already configured to offer access to the cluster.

Steps to deploy `Netclient` to your `DOKS` cluster:

1. Fetch the `Netclient` template for `DOKS` from the `Gravitl` Netmaker GitHub repository:

    ```shell
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitl/netmaker/master/kube/netclient-template-doks.yaml > netclient-template-doks.yaml
    ```

2. Next, please open and inspect the manifest file using a text editor of your choice (preferably with `YAML` lint support). For example, you can use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download):

    ```shell
    code netclient-template-doks.yaml
    ```

3. Search for the `TOKEN` environment variable from the manifest `spec.containers` field. Sample snippet provided below:

    ```yaml
    ...
    spec:
      hostNetwork: true
      containers:
      - name: netclient-1
        image: gravitl/netclient:0.9.2-doks
        env:
        ...
        - name: TOKEN
          value: "<token>"
    ```

4. Now, replace the `<>` placeholders from the TOKEN environment variable value with the access token generated at `Step 9.` from [Configuring Netmaker Server](#configuring-netmaker-server).
5. Save the manifest file, and run `kubectl apply` (first a dedicated `namespace` is created as well):

    ```shell
    kubectl create ns netmaker

    kubectl apply -f netclient-template-doks.yaml -n netmaker
    ```

After completing all the above steps, a new `DaemonSet` is created in your DOKS cluster running required `Netclients` (and WireGuard) on each node. After a few moments everything should be up and running. Please note that the `Netclient` containers can restart a few times until the `WireGuard Controller` is ready - this is normal.

**Hint:**

You may wonder how nodes know to contact the main Netmaker server (like public or floating IP address for example). This information is stored in the access token that you generated for your network earlier.

Now, please go ahead and inspect the new Kubernetes resources created in the `netmaker` namespace, as well as their state:

```shell
kubectl get all -n netmaker
```

The output looks similar to (`netclient` and the `wireguard-controller` pods should be up and running):

```text
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/netclient-1-6w74k            1/1     Running   0          114s
pod/netclient-1-pdm8p            1/1     Running   0          114s
pod/wireguard-controller-49mrj   1/1     Running   0          114s
pod/wireguard-controller-hr89h   1/1     Running   0          114s

NAME                                  DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR   AGE
daemonset.apps/netclient-1            2         2         2       2            2           <none>          114s
daemonset.apps/wireguard-controller   2         2         2       2            2           <none>          114s
```

Next, check that `Netclient` pods run on each node from your cluster:

```shell
kubectl get pods -n netmaker -o wide
```

The output looks similar to (notice that each is running on a separate node, as seen in the `NODE` column):

```text
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP           NODE            NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
netclient-1-6w74k            1/1     Running   0          26m   10.106.0.4   basicnp-uan1g   <none>           <none>
netclient-1-pdm8p            1/1     Running   0          26m   10.106.0.2   basicnp-uan1e   <none>           <none>
wireguard-controller-49mrj   1/1     Running   0          26m   10.106.0.2   basicnp-uan1e   <none>           <none>
wireguard-controller-hr89h   1/1     Running   0          26m   10.106.0.4   basicnp-uan1g   <none>           <none>
```

If the output looks similar to the one from above, you configured `Netclients` successfully. For troubleshooting possible issues, you can always inspect each pod logs, or take a look at the events to find useful information.

Finally, open the Netmaker server dashboard and navigate to the `Nodes` page. You should see your DOKS cluster nodes joined your private network, and the `Healthy` status:

![DOKS Egress Setup](assets/images/doks_egress_network.png)

Looking at the above, you can also notice that the main Netmaker server is part of your private network, and that it's acting as an Egress Gateway (denoted by the green pass mark in the egress column).

**Notes:**

- It may happen for some  `Netclients` to not succeed in joining your private network. What you can do in this case is click the `Sync` button on the top right corner:

![Healthy](assets/images/doks_network_nodes_sync.png)

- If the sync operation still doesn't solve this issue, you can ultimately kill the respective pods. The DaemonSet will spawn fresh ones, and the join process should start again (nodes communicate with master node, meaning the Netmaker server via GRPC calls).

Next, you will test the egress setup by deploying the `curl-test` pod in your cluster. Then, you will make a request from the `curl-test` pod to [ifconfig.me](https://ifconfig.me), to see if it's the `Egress Gateway IP` that your DOKS cluster is using to connect to the outside world.

### Testing the DOKS Egress Setup

To test your egress setup, you need to check if all the `requests` originating from your `DOKS` cluster travel via a single node - the `Egress Gateway`. The simplest way to test, is by making a `curl` request to [ifconfig.me/ip](https://ifconfig.me/ip), and see if the response contains your `Egress Gateway Floating IP` address.

First, you need to create the `curl-test` pod in your `DOKS` cluster (the `default` namespace is used):

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitalocean/container-blueprints/main/netmaker-egress-gateway/assets/manifests/curl-test.yaml
```

Verify that the pod is up and running (in the `default` namespace):

```shell
kubectl get pods
```

The output looks similar to (`curl-test` pod `Status` should be `Running`):

```text
NAME       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
curl-test   1/1     Running   0          7s
```

Then, perform a `HTTP` request to [ifconfig.me](https://ifconfig.me), from the `curl-test` pod:

```shell
kubectl exec -it curl-test -- curl https://ifconfig.me
```

The output looks similar to:

```text
159.65.210.139
```

The resulting IP address that gets printed should be the floating IP address that you assigned to your Netmaker droplet. If so, then you configured the `Egress Gateway` successfully.

### Checking WireGuard Configuration

WireGuard sits at the heart of Netmaker, and it is the power horse that makes everything kicking and alive.

One of the Netmaker main goals is to simplify operations, meaning it handles WireGuard configuration automatically for you. As an exercise, and to discover more about WireGuard, you can take a look at how Netmaker configured everything for you under the hood. WireGuard has a little utility called `wg`, which you can use to query configuration information. You're not limited only to that, but you can even set or change the actual configuration if so desired. On the other hand, this breaks the purpose and simplicity of Netmaker, as it already takes care of hiding the complexity of configuring WireGuard for you.

Checking WireGuard configuration can be accomplished by invoking the `wg` utility from the CLI. Please follow below steps:

1. First, list the available `Netclient` pods from the `netmaker` namespace used in this tutorial:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -n netmaker
    ```

    The output looks similar to:

    ```text
    NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    netclient-1-ch2jp            1/1     Running   0          23m
    netclient-1-h2xjr            1/1     Running   0          23m
    wireguard-controller-9st95   1/1     Running   0          33m
    wireguard-controller-zwwz6   1/1     Running   0          33m
    ```

2. Now, you can invoke the `wg show` command from one of the `Netclient` pods:

    ```shell
    kubectl exec -it pod/netclient-1-ch2jp -n netmaker -- wg show
    ```

    The output looks similar to:

    ```text
    interface: nm-do-net
    public key: Mtx0OmJpshOC+cirh+/zHIjt4U4q4XudbLYesJtgQSw=
    private key: (hidden)
    listening port: 51821

    peer: CA4reOG2iC3v2Knik14u4wLKmEk85RmMmnWSgZemmzc=
    endpoint: 159.65.210.139:51821
    allowed ips: 10.101.56.1/32
    latest handshake: 1 minute ago
    transfer: 1.20 KiB received, 4.74 KiB sent
    persistent keepalive: every 20 seconds

    peer: B9kL17HCVXm3U0TykqaoZqTeaJ8jA5DAp65J7ZDmlVA=
    endpoint: 10.114.0.3:51821
    allowed ips: 10.101.56.2/32
    latest handshake: 1 minute, 58 seconds ago
    transfer: 1.16 KiB received, 4.62 KiB sent
    persistent keepalive: every 20 seconds
    ```

3. Next, go ahead and do the same thing for the other pod:

    ```shell
    kubectl exec -it pod/netclient-1-h2xjr -n netmaker -- wg show
    ```

    The output looks similar to:

    ```text
    interface: nm-do-net
    public key: B9kL17HCVXm3U0TykqaoZqTeaJ8jA5DAp65J7ZDmlVA=
    private key: (hidden)
    listening port: 51821

    peer: Mtx0OmJpshOC+cirh+/zHIjt4U4q4XudbLYesJtgQSw=
    endpoint: 10.114.0.4:51821
    allowed ips: 10.101.56.3/32
    latest handshake: 19 seconds ago
    transfer: 6.00 KiB received, 1.61 KiB sent
    persistent keepalive: every 20 seconds

    peer: CA4reOG2iC3v2Knik14u4wLKmEk85RmMmnWSgZemmzc=
    endpoint: 159.65.210.139:51821
    allowed ips: 10.101.56.1/32
    latest handshake: 58 seconds ago
    transfer: 1.92 KiB received, 7.65 KiB sent
    persistent keepalive: every 20 seconds
    ```

`Netclient` (and `WireGuard` implicitly) is deployed as a `DaemonSet`. It means that, it runs on every node of your cluster, thus allowing it to connect to your private network (based on an access token).

Going further, if you look carefully at the above `wg show` command outputs, you can see that each pod (or each worker node basically) is establishing a peer connection with other nodes from your Netmaker private network. What this means is that a `mesh network` is formed. Remember the little discussion about mesh networks and the Netmaker architecture diagram at the beginning of this tutorial ?

Go ahead and take a look at the private IP address for each worker node:

```shell
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

The output looks similar to (notice the `INTERNAL-IP` column values):

```text
NAME            STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION   INTERNAL-IP ...
basicnp-u2orj   Ready    <none>   29h   v1.21.5   10.114.0.3  ...
basicnp-u2orr   Ready    <none>   29h   v1.21.5   10.114.0.4  ...
```

As you can see in the above output, each node is peering with the other nodes from your DOKS cluster via the private (internal) network. A peer connection is also established with the Netmaker server over its floating IP address. You may wonder why DOKS internal nodes peer with the Netmaker server via the public interface. Well, this is by design - remember that the Netmaker server is supposed to be publicly accessible so that you can connect any resources from any network no matter where is located, as long as it has access to the internet. You need not to worry about your traffic being publicly exposed because everything goes encrypted via the WireGuard tunnel.

**Note:**

If desired, you can enforce all traffic to go via the internal network (or VPC) where your Netmaker server is deployed. This aspect will be covered in a dedicated guide for this tutorial.

You can check what other options are available for the `wg` command by inspecting the `help` page:

```shell
wg --help
```

The output looks similar to:

```text
Usage: wg <cmd> [<args>]

Available subcommands:
  show: Shows the current configuration and device information
  showconf: Shows the current configuration of a given WireGuard interface, for use with `setconf'
  set: Change the current configuration, add peers, remove peers, or change peers
  setconf: Applies a configuration file to a WireGuard interface
  addconf: Appends a configuration file to a WireGuard interface
  syncconf: Synchronizes a configuration file to a WireGuard interface
  genkey: Generates a new private key and writes it to stdout
  genpsk: Generates a new preshared key and writes it to stdout
  pubkey: Reads a private key from stdin and writes a public key to stdout
You may pass `--help' to any of these subcommands to view usage.
```

## Summary

In this tutorial you learned how to use Netmaker to define and manage private networks from a central point. You also learned how to create and use an Egress Gateway for your DOKS cluster. This way, external services like databases for example, can see a single source IP in the packets coming from your DOKS cluster, thus making firewall rules management easier on the other end.
